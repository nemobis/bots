## This use of GitHub is not an endorsement

This project is currently hosted by GitHub for legacy reasons.
GitHub is not recommended as it's a service running on proprietary software
and does not respect copyleft.

I'm happy to move this one-person project to a freedom-respecting forge if you
need to interact with it and you find yourself executing proprietary software
(i.e. anything beyond git commands on your local machine).
